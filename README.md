# Compile-Principle-Course

Compile Principle Course Projects &amp; Labs

## Labs

Contains the following 4 labs ( 2022-Fall )

- [x] Lab1 (DNCompress) : Compress & decompress the C++ files 
- [x] Lab2 (R2DFA) : Convert regular expressions to minimized DFA
- [x] Lab3 (GPProcessor) : Grammar problem processor
- [x] Lab4 (eTINY) : Extends TINY’s grammar & syntax tree’s generation

### Environment

Qt Creator 10.0.1 based on Qt 6.4.1

MinGW 11.2.0 64bit

### Suggested arrangement

- 28 days / Lab
- Detailed documentation is required to describe the general architecture of the program, as well as the design, main functions, and algorithm implementation



## Projects

Contains the following 3 tasks ( 2023-Spring )

### Mandatory content

- [x] Task1: Convert regular expression( high-level language’s) to  generate a lexical analysis program ( Use C )

  - [x] Test with regular expressions of the TINY language

  - [x] Display NFA with state transition table or diagram

  - [x] Display DFA with state transition table or diagram

  - [x] Display minimized DFA with state transition table or diagram

  - [x] Generate a lexical analysis program based on the minimized DFA ( Use C )

  - [x] Compile this lexical analysis source program with a C/C++ compiler and generate an executable program

  - [x] Test with TINY language：

    > Test with a source program of the high-level programming language, and output the word code of the source program. A window needs to be provided so that the user can view the word code.

- [x] Task2: Process BNF Grammar’s problem
  - [x] Simplify the grammar (Presented in table form)
  - [x] Eliminate the left recursion & left common factor (Presented in table form)
  - [x] Solve the first set & follow set (Presented in table forms)
  - [x] Construct LL(1) analysis table (Presented in table form)
  - [x] Use LL(1) table for (TINY Language’s) syntax analysis 
    - [x] & then generate a :x:syntax tree(abandoned) ✔️analysis tree (Presented in tree form)
  
- [x] Task3: Use mini-C Language’s  to test
  - [x] Use mini-C Language’s Lex to test & use at least one TINY’s source program to test the generated lexer
  - [x] Use mini-C Language’s Grammar to test & analyzing the encoded file (generated by the lexer) to generate its syntax tree

### Optional Content

Syntax analysis is carried out using the LL(1) syntax analysis method and the corresponding intermediate code is produced. The intermediate code can be optional (it can be intermediate code such as quadratic, ternary, pseudo-code, etc.) and the results of the intermediate code production can be displayed on screen or saved in the form of a file

### Environment

Same as above
