Compile Principle Course Projects &amp; Labs

## Labs

Contains the following 4 labs

- [x] Lab1: Compress & decompress the C++ files 
- [x] Lab2: Convert regular expression to minimized DFA
- [x] Lab3: Grammar problem processor
- [x] Lab4: Extends TINY grammar & syntax tree’s generation

### Environment

Qt Creator 9.0.0 based on Qt 6.4.2

MinGW 11.2.0 64bit

## Projects

Contains the following 3 tasks

- [ ] Task1: Convert regular expression( high-level language’s) to minimized DFA, and generate a scanner program(using C++)
- [ ] Task2: Process BNF Grammar’s problem
  - [ ] Simplify the grammar
  - [ ] Eliminate the left recursion & left common factor
  - [ ] Solve the first set & follow set
  - [ ] Construct LL(1) analysis table
  - [ ] Use LL(1) for syntax analysis & then generate a syntax tree
- [ ] Task3: Use mini-C’s Lexical & Grammar to test
  - [ ] Use mini-C’s Lexical to test & use at least one src program to test the Lexical analysis
  - [ ] Use mini-C’s Grammar to test & analyzing the encoded file (generated by the src program) to generate its syntax tree
