# Compile-Principle-Course

Compile Principle Course Projects &amp; Labs

## Labs

Contains the following 4 labs ( 2022-Fall )

- [x] Lab1 (DNCompress) : Compress & decompress the C++ files 
- [x] Lab2 (R2DFA) : Convert regular expressions to minimized DFA
- [x] Lab3 (GPProcessor) : Grammar problem processor
- [x] Lab4 (eTINY) : Extends TINY’s grammar & syntax tree’s generation

### Environment

Qt Creator 9.0.0 based on Qt 6.4.2

MinGW 11.2.0 64bit



## Projects

Contains the following 3 tasks ( 2023-Spring )

- [x] Task1: Convert regular expression( high-level language’s) to  generate a lexical analysis program ( Use C )

  - [x] Test with regular expressions of the TINY language

  - [x] Display NFA with state transition table or diagram

  - [x] Display DFA with state transition table or diagram

  - [x] Display minimized DFA with state transition table or diagram

  - [x] Generate a lexical analysis program based on the minimized DFA ( Use C )

  - [x] Compile this lexical analysis source program with a C/C++ compiler and generate an executable program

  - [x] Test with TINY language：

    > Test with a source program of the high-level programming language, and output the word code of the source program. A window needs to be provided so that the user can view the word code.

- [ ] Task2: Process BNF Grammar’s problem
  - [x] Simplify the grammar (Presented in table form)
  - [x] Eliminate the left recursion & left common factor (Presented in table form)
  - [x] Solve the first set & follow set (Presented in table forms)
  - [ ] Construct LL(1) analysis table (Presented in table form)
  - [ ] Use LL(1) for (TINY Language’s) syntax analysis & then generate a syntax tree (Presented in tree form)
  
- [ ] Task3: Use mini-C Language’s  to test
  - [ ] Use mini-C Language’s Lex to test & use at least one TINY’s source program to test the generated lexer
  - [ ] Use mini-C Language’s Grammar to test & analyzing the encoded file (generated by the lexer) to generate its syntax tree

### Environment

Same as above
