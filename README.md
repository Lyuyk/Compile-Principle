- [ ] Process BNF Grammar’s problem
  - [ ] Simplify the grammar
  - [ ] Eliminate the left recursion & left common factor
  - [ ] Solve the first set & follow set
  - [ ] Construct LL(1) analysis table
  - [ ] Use LL(1) for syntax analysis & then generate a syntax tree
- [ ] Use mini-C’s Lexical & Grammar to test
  - [ ] Use mini-C’s Lexical to test & use at least one src program to test the Lexical analysis
  - [ ] Use mini-C’s Grammar to test & analyzing the encoded file (generated by the src program) to generate its syntax tree
